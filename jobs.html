<p>Open Law Library is a small nonprofit tech startup and open access legal publisher dedicated to making the law accessible to all.</p>

<p>We are taking the tools and techniques developed for programmers to publish software code - IDEs, linters, compilers, continuous integration/deployment, VCS, etc - and adapting and transforming them for use by lawyers to publish legal codes. Governments use our tools to save time and money and then publish their laws openly for the public. The founders are two lawyer/programmers (Scala, Python, and Javascript). Our funding is a mix of donations, grants, and government contracts.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a meaningful way to contribute to our democracy, you find joy in building the perfect tools for your users, you like deep and challenging problems in such diverse areas as version control, DSL design, UI/UX, and NLP (more accurately, LLP - Legal Language Processing :), and the idea of helping build a team excites you, then drop us a line at <a href="mailto:jobs@openlawlib.org">jobs@openlawlib.org</a>.</p>

<p>Benefits include health insurance, retirement with matching, generous leave, and a training stipend.</p>

<p>These positions are eligible for federal student loan forgiveness if you <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service">meet program requirements</a>.</p>

<h5 id="c-senior-developer-remote-in-u-s">C# Senior Developer (remote in U.S.)</h5>

<p>Government lawyers live and breath MS Office, so our tools must integrate seamlessly with their MS-centric workflows. We are looking to hire a C# developer to help us build out our Microsoft technologies team. You would be leading our user-facing tool development projects, which consist of MS Word plugins and VS Code plugins. You would also be helping with our backend infrastructure built in .NET Core and Python. When applying or inquiring, please include the phrase C# in square brackets in the subject line.</p>

<p>We are looking for someone with 5+ years of .net development. MS Office integration experience a plus, but not in any way required. Experience building developer tools, such as IntelliSense a big plus.</p>
