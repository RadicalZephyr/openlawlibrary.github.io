<p>Open Law Library is a small nonprofit tech startup and open access legal publisher dedicated to making the law accessible to all.</p>

<p>We are taking the tools and techniques developed for programmers to publish software code - IDEs, linters, compilers, continuous integration/deployment, VCS, etc - and adapting and transforming them for use by lawyers to publish legal codes. Governments use our tools to save time and money and then publish their laws openly for the public. The founders are two lawyer/programmers (Scala, Python, and Javascript). Our funding is a mix of donations, grants, and government contracts.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a meaningful way to contribute to our democracy, you find joy in building the perfect tools for your users, you like deep and challenging problems in such diverse areas as version control, DSL design, UI/UX, and NLP (more accurately, LLP - Legal Language Processing :), and the idea of helping build a team excites you, then drop us a line at <a href="mailto:jobs@openlawlib.org">jobs@openlawlib.org</a>.</p>

<p>Benefits include health insurance, retirement with matching, generous leave, and a training stipend.</p>
